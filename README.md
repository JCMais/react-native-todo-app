# React Native Sample Todo App

This project is (will be) the result of a code challenge made for a job 
  opportunity at [@entria](https://github.com/entria), and also as a self-learning project. 

### Server

The included server is based on [@entria/graphql-dataloader-boilerplate](https://github.com/),
 created using the awesome tool  [create-graphql](https://github.com/lucasbento/create-graphql).


#### Challenge Entria

##### Create a React Native app
- [x] it should run on both iOS and Android (I cannot test on iOS, but it _should_ run)
- [x] it should use Relay
- [x] it should use one or more of the schemas available on https://www.graphqlhub.com/ or our boilerplate https://github.com/entria/graphql-dataloader-boilerplate
- [x] it should show the content inside a ListView (a list of reddit or hackernews or github or twitter or a mix of them)
- [x] it should be open sourced on your github repo
